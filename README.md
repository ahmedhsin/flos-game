-   **Backend:**  Node.js, Socket.IO
-   **Testing:**  Mocha, Chai
-   **Deployment:**
    -   Frontend: GitHub Pages (Continuous Integration)

**Dependencies:**

**Deployment:**

The frontend and backend are deployed separately:

-   **Frontend:**  The frontend is continuously deployed to GitHub Pages. You can access the live version at [https://ahmedhsin.github.io/flos-game/].
